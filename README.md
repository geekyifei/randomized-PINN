## Overview
This repo contains JAX-based implementations of randomized PINNs (rPINNs), which inject randomness into the PINN loss function to generate posterior samples for inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). This method provides a scalable alternative to traditional Bayesian inference techniques for physics-constrained problems.

Key features:
- Efficient and scalable uncertainty quantification in PDE inverse problems with data assimilation
- Outperforms Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) methods, while they suffer from the curse of dimensionality and ill-conditioned posterior covariance structure. Additionally, rPINN is highly parallelizable.
- We propose a weighted-likelihood Bayesian PINN formulation to balance contributions from different terms (e.g., PDE, IC, BC residuals, measurements).
